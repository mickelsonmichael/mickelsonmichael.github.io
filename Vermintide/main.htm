                <hr />
                <p>Several tomes can be found each mission. Tomes replace the primary item slot for your character, where a medical kit or healing daught would normally go, and will display a message to all party members when picked up.</p>
                <p>At the end of every level, a "tome die" will replace one of the standard dice for each tome carried by a player. This die has a higher probability of giving an item upgrade than the white die.</p>
                <p><b>There are no negative effects to carrying a tome besides taking up inventory space.</b></p>

                <p>Grimoires replace the potion slot of your inventory, where a potion of strength or speed would normally go.</p>
                <p><b>Picking up the tome reduces the health of all party members by a third. This effect stacks with multiple Grimoires.</b></p>
                <p>At the end of every level, a "grimoire die" will replace one of the standard dice for each grimoire carried by a player. This die has the highest probability of giving a weapon upgrade (100%).</p>

                <p>When picked up, the die will give the entire team an improved chance of a weapon upgrade.</p>

                <hr />
                <p>This website is built as a personal project to learn <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS (version 1.x)</a> and <a href="https://semantic-ui.com/" target="_blank">Semantic UI</a>. It also includes <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank">FontAwesome</a> content.</p>
                <p>The initial goal was to use entireley Sementic UI for styling, but upon exploration, it would appear that Semantic UI doesn't provide ideal resizing when the Window size changes (unlike Bootstrap). So instead a combination of Bootstrap and Semeantic UI was used.</p>
                <p>This home page is made entirely of Bootstrap elements. The Act pages are made primarily of Semantic UI elements with Bootstrap grids to promote proper resizing.</p>
