                <hr />
                <p>Several tomes can be found each mission. Tomes replace the primary item slot for your character, where a medical kit or healing daught would normally go, and will display a message to all party members when picked up.</p>
                <p>At the end of every level, a "tome die" will replace one of the standard dice for each tome carried by a player. This die has a higher probability of giving an item upgrade than the white die.</p>
                <p><b>There are no negative effects to carrying a tome besides taking up inventory space.</b></p>

                <p>Grimoires replace the potion slot of your inventory, where a potion of strength or speed would normally go.</p>
                <p><b>Picking up the tome reduces the health of all party members by a third. This effect stacks with multiple Grimoires.</b></p>
                <p>At the end of every level, a "grimoire die" will replace one of the standard dice for each grimoire carried by a player. This die has the highest probability of giving a weapon upgrade (100%).</p>

                <p>A Cursed Die is a special die found within chests or on the body of special rats.</p>
                <p>When picked up, the die will give the entire team an improved chance of a weapon upgrade.</p>
                <p><b>There are no negative effects to picking up a Cursed Die (despite the name), and they do not replace any inventory slots.</b></p>
