                <p>Several tomes can be found each mission. Tomes replace the primary item slot for your character, where a medical kit or healing daught would normally go, and will display a message to all party members when picked up.</p>
                <p>At the end of every level, a "tome die" will replace one of the standard dice for each tome carried by a player. This die has a higher probability of giving an item upgrade than the white die.</p>
                <p><b>There are no negative effects to carrying a tome besides taking up inventory space.</b></p>
